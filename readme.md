Week 6 day 2 Automation Lab

In this lab, I completed tests on Google's homepage by downloading the lab content, navigating to the testgoogle folder, and running 'npm i'. I addressed the TODO comments in the 'google.test.js' file, following the provided comments. To run the tests, I executed 'npm test'. In the second part, I switched to the 'moviesapp' folder, installed dependencies using 'npm i', and tested the UI of the Movies List app from the 'public/' folder. I created a new test file, set up a beforeEach function to connect to the app's URL, and an afterEach function to quit the driver. I then wrote at least three distinct tests to assess different functionalities of the Movies List app, such as crossing off a movie, deleting a movie, and verifying the display of notifications.
